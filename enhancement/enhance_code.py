This code snippet defines the `enhance_code` function, which takes a string of code as input and returns an enhanced version of it. The enhancement process includes refactoring the code, adding comments to complex parts, and formatting the code to improve readability and style. The `utils` submodules like `code_refactoring`, `documentation_utils`, and `code_style` are assumed to be part of the shared dependencies and should contain the relevant functionality. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is an example of how the `enhance_code` function could be used.
