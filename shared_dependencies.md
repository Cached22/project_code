Shared dependencies between the files we are generating include:

- Function names:
  - `refactor_code_structure`
  - `simplify_code`
  - `enhance_code_readability`
  - `add_comments_to_complex_code`
  - `enhance_code`
  - `add_docstrings_to_functions` (from `utils/documentation_utils.py`)

- Imported modules and libraries:
  - `ast` (from the Python standard library)
  - `parse` (from `refactorlib.cheetah.parse`)
  - `parse_python` (from `refactorlib.python.parse`)
  - `libcst` (to be used in the rewritten functions)

- Exceptions:
  - `Exception`
  - `SyntaxError`

- Argument names:
  - `code` (used in all function definitions)

- Return types:
  - `str` (all functions return a string representing the modified code)

- Documentation strings (docstrings) for functions:
  - Descriptions of the purpose and usage of each function

Please note that the actual implementation of the shared dependencies, such as the logic within each function and the specific transformations applied to the code, are not detailed here. The focus is solely on the names of the shared dependencies.
